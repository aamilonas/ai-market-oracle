  "summary": "Week 7 saw Claude pull further ahead on the leaderboard with a +4.1 point week, driven by correctly calling inflation data reaction across multiple tickers. The CPI print came in line with expectations on Wednesday, which Claude predicted would trigger a relief rally — and it did. Grok had the week's highest-conviction wrong call: a 0.85-confidence bearish bet on QQQ that lost 0.85 points when tech surged 2.3% on Thursday. GPT-4o quietly had its most consistent week, going 8/13 on direction calls with above-average accuracy.",
