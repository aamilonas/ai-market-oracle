  "headline": "AI Earnings Dominate: NVDA Consensus Split, SPY Divided Across Models",
  "summary": "Today's predictions reveal a market divided on tech's direction following strong AI earnings, particularly Nvidia's beat on Q4 revenue ($68.13B). Three models (GPT-4o, Grok, Perplexity) bullishly aligned on SPY while Claude and Perplexity diverged. NVDA saw the most disagreement with Claude and Perplexity predicting upside versus GPT-4o's bearish call, while CRM faced near-consensus bearishness on disappointing FY2027 guidance.",
