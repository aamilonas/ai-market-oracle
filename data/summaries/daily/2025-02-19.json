  "summary": "Four out of five models missed on SPY direction today, betting on a bounce that never came. The index fell 0.7% on the day as Fed rate-cut skepticism weighed on sentiment. The notable outlier: Claude correctly called the SPY decline with 68% confidence, earning 1.18 points. Meanwhile, all three models that predicted NVDA agreed on upside — and while the stock did rise, target prices were more aggressive than the modest 1.2% gain delivered. Gemini's Home Depot call was the day's top-scoring prediction at 1.79 points, nailing the post-earnings selloff with high conviction.",
