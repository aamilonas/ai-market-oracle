  "headline": "Five AI models bullish on tech recovery with sparse disagreement on direction",
  "summary": "All five AI models predicted broad market upside on 2026-02-24, with strong consensus around SPY, QQQ, and AAPL rallies following pre-market momentum gains. Claude stood out with high-conviction calls on AMD (0.85 confidence) and HD (0.80 confidence) based on specific catalysts, while only two downside predictions emerged (NVDA and TSLA). However, no actual closing prices were recorded, leaving all predictions pending verification.",
