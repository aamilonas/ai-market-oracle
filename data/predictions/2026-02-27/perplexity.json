  "market_context": "US stock futures are sliding lower on February 27, 2026, with S&P 500 futures down 0.2-0.35%, Nasdaq 100 futures down 0.30%, and Dow futures down 0.50%, primarily due to Nvidia's 5-5.5% after-hours drop despite strong earnings, raising tech valuation concerns.[1][3][5] Netflix shares rallied 9-11% in after-hours after dropping its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, seen as financially prudent, while pre-market movers like Accenture (+8.29%) and TKO Group (+8.01%) show selective strength.[1][3][4] Mixed signals include lower mortgage rates at 5.98% and improving Kansas Fed Manufacturing Index at 10, amid broader caution from macroeconomic risks and VIX spike.[3]",
