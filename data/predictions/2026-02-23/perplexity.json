  "market_context": "US equity index futures are lower, with S&P 500 and Dow contracts down 0.4% and Nasdaq futures off 0.6%, driven by uncertainty from President Trump's 15% blanket tariffs imposed after the Supreme Court's ruling against prior measures.[1][2] Treasury yields have slipped below 4.06% amid safe-haven demand, while core PCE inflation at 3% supports higher-for-longer rates, pressuring tech and growth sectors.[2] Pre-market shows mixed movers like Corning up 7% but tech names like Nebius and CoreWeave down sharply on AI concerns.[2]",
