  "headline": "Trade Uncertainty Splits AI Models on Market Direction Today",
  "summary": "AI models were sharply divided on 2026-02-23, with Claude and Perplexity predicting market weakness due to Supreme Court trade ruling and tariff concerns, while GPT-4o and Grok expected gains from positive pre-market sentiment. The day featured a notable clash between bearish technical analysis (Claude's strong VIX call at 0.78 confidence) and bullish narrative predictions (multiple models citing earnings optimism). With actual closing prices unavailable, outcome scoring remains pending across all 15 predictions.",
