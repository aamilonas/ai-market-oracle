  "headline": "Tariff turmoil divides AI bulls from macro bears in earnings week",
  "summary": "Claude and Perplexity diverged sharply on market direction today, with Perplexity citing Trump's tariff announcement as a broad headwind for equities while Claude maintained bullish stances on individual names like NVDA and DPZ ahead of earnings. Both models agreed QQQ should decline, but disagreed on magnitude and reasoning—Perplexity blamed tariff supply chain risks while Claude pointed to technical resistance. Actual close data is pending, making it unclear whether tariff fears or pre-earnings momentum dominated.",
