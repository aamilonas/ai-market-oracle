  "market_context": "Markets face mixed signals with SPY futures down 0.2%, QQQ futures down 0.3%, and DIA futures down 0.4% in premarket trading. Tech selloff continues following Nvidia's earnings disappointment despite beating estimates, while AI concerns and geopolitical tensions weigh on sentiment as February concludes.",

      "confidence": 0.72,
      "reasoning": "SPY futures down 0.2% premarket with technical resistance at 6,900 S&P level mentioned as critical support. Bearish MACD histogram and elevated P/E at 27.76 increase vulnerability to continued selling pressure from tech sector weakness."

      "reasoning": "Despite beating estimates with $1.62 EPS vs $1.53 expected and $68.13B revenue, NVDA fell 5% as market is in 'prove it' mode. Psychological resistance at $200 level and concerns over sustainability of AI rally create downside pressure."
